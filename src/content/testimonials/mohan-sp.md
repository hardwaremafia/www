I've been part of the Hardware Mafia for a year now, and it's been invaluable. The members offer great support and solutions across a wide range of technical and entrepreneurial areas. In the hardware space, finding such a supportive community is rare. If you're a hardware startup, join this community â€“ you won't have to navigate your entrepreneurial journey alone.
